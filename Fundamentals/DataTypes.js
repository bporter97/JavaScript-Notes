// There are primitive Data Types and Reference Data Types in Javascript.
// Primitive Data types, data is stored directly in the location that the variable accesses.
// Reference Data types: Data is Accessed by references; there is a pointer that points to a location in memory.
// Primitive Data types include: Strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined and symbols.
// Reference Data Types include: Arrays, object literals, functions and dates.
// Types are associated with values, not variables, and the same variable can hold multiple Types.
// Javascript is dynamically typed.

// Strings
const name = 'John Doe';
console.log(typeof name) //typeof: Allows you to see the type of data that is stored in a variable

//numbers
const age = 32;

//Boolean
const isTrue = True;

//null
const movie = null

//undefined
let test;
