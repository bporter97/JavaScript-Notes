I know what you're thinking, "this idiot named his files starting with a number!".
Yes I know this; this is mainly for the new people wondering where they should start at.
That being said, NEW PEOPLE; any files, variables, classes, modules,
methods, object or pretty much anything in any programming language, should not start with a number.
Nobody is stopping you from doing this, however it's just bad manners to do so, and everyone who has ever
programmed will rip you a new one. Also your code may be all screwy and not work.

Don't say I didn't warn you.
